# MovieSpot

## üßê What is MovieSpot?

[MovieSpot](https://moviespotgame.netlify.app/) is a little game that I designed in 2 days. The goal is to find all the movies and series associated with the images of places and settings.
This little project allowed me to reuse concepts I learned and to improve my JS skills, especially DOM and object manipulation.
For the front-end, I used [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) to learn about CSS libraries.

## üëâ How it works

There are a number of images to find. The goal is to find them all in a row, without making mistakes.
For each image, several spellings are valid and capital letters are not taken into account.
If a correct answer is found, you move on to the next image and the progress counter is updated. However, if a wrong answer is given, you lose one life. Note that you have two lives before the game resets.

To make the game a little easier, there's a hint you can toggle. Of course, the aim is to finish the game without it, but some of the images are tricky.

:warning: This project is for educational purpose only. All the images I used are the property of their authors.
